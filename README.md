# Vega

This is a small project to setup a small repository of metrics and visualise them through cubism.js

## Installation

My working environment is Ubuntu 14.04 but the software required for this project is available in other operative systems and distributions.
You need a very small setup to get this working:
* InfluxDB 0.9
* Ruby 2.x
* Sinatra Gem
* D3.js Javascript Library
* Cubism.js Javascript Library

Alternatively I will recommend to install the package *jq* in Ubuntu to be able to run the same commands and queries as shown in the examples
